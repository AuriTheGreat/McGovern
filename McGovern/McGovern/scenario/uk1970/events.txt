	description:
		When Labour, led by Harold Wilson, took office in October 1964, it was immediately faced 
		with a deficit of 800 million pounds, which contributed to a series of sterling crises. 
		A possible solution was to devalue the pound against other currencies to make imports 
		more expensive (which meant more inflation), but exports cheaper, causing an increase.

		By the summer of 1966, the pressure on sterling was acute but Wilson was determined to 
		resist devaluation. To him the pound was a symbol of national status, of Britain's role 
		in the world as a key player. On 12 July 1966 the Cabinet rejected the devaluation option 
		and agreed to a tough package of deflation and austerity instead.
